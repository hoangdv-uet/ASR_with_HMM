using Ai2thor to controll the Robot

  Run: sudo python voice4robot.py
  
all scrip you can use at corpus.txt
Eg: say "MOVE TWO GIRD" => the robot will move forward 2 grid at the room (you can command from ONE to NINE grid)
Say "SPIN LEFF" or "SPIN RIGHT" => the robot will spin to the left or right 90 deg
Say "TURN" => the screen will change to another room
Say "TURN OFF" => the program will exit!
!HAVE FUN WITH THAT
